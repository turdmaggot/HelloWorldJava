# HelloWorldJava

A kickstart project for Java for beginners so they can understand the compilation and running process.

I suggest you get a copy of Headfirst Java. That book really has it all and will bring you a long way.




## Prerequisites:

* Clone this project, or download it.

* Get an IDE. You can begin with Notepad++.

This should compile your code and generate the class file.
